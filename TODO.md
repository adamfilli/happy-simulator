1. Queued Entity - still in progress, having issues with a good queued entity
    - rename "server" to just "Target" or "Resource" in queue implementation and tests
2. Event Lifecycles (i.e. a source that creates an event with a predefined lifecycle)
3. Rate Limiter
    - Distributed convergence example
    - Burst suppression 
4. Queueing network recreations: https://www.grotto-networking.com/DiscreteEventPython.html
5. Model client server ping pong communications
6. Add global clock to simulation and entities
